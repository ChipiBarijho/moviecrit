# MovieCrit

MovieCrit is a web application intended for users to post reviews for movies.

## Tech Used
### Backend
The backend is built on Node.js using the Express.js web framework. The database chosen for the project was MongoDB, using the Mongoose ODM to connect the backend with the database.
When it comes to user authentication, [Passportjs](https://www.passportjs.org/) is used with the JWT strategy.

Why did I choose Node.js and MongoDB for the backend?
MovieCrit was my third ever project, and I was already familiar with Node.js and MongoDB from using them in other projects. Even though I was familiar with this stack I felt that I needed to learn more and feel more comfortable with Node.js and MongoDB, and to improve my Node.js and MongoDB skills I believe the best way to do it is to actually use them a lot.

### Frontend
React is used in the frontend. 
To obtain the movies' metadata, I decided to use [TMDB's API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

Why did I choose React for the frontend?
This is my first big project using React after learning it in Colt Steele's Udemy course.
This project helped me immensely to improve my knowledge and usage of React.
